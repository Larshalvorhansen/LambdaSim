# intrinsicValueEstimator
In tiny sub project I'm trying to estimate the real value of assets in this case from finn.no data in order to make better decisions when making purchases.

So far, the program "main.py" fetches all the articles on a specified searchpage url on finn, scrapes the HTML and finally outputs some info from each page such as adress, price and description into one single csv file called data5.csv
