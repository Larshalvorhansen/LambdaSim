🌐 This GitHub project is (currently) a solo venture aimed at simulating and visualizing complex systems in two dimensions, 
aspiring to one day make a meaningful contribution to the feild of complexity theory.  

🌱 It starts simply with an agent moving randomly and eating randomly generated food, laying the foundation for emergent complexity.

👥 This project serves as a pringboard to my next project where the goal is to simulate mechanisms in society. 
🏙️ I.e. testing various economic/political models on simulated "agents" and comparing results etc.

🎨The simulation seeks to be both visually captivating and informative, 
with easily editable parameters to encourage user experimentation. 

🔥Targeting a wide audience, from friends to industry professionals, 
and aims to ignite a passion for complex adaptive systems.

🤝Feel free to reach out if you wish to collaborate, give feedback, or explore this project together with me!
