# Plan V2

## Overarching objective: 
Create a tool or gain the ability to improve dectitionmaking using agent based simulation
### Requirements: 
1. Become an agent based modeling genius
2. Create or build upon an existing tool
    - Start by makeing simple agent based simulations in Netlogo
      - Write about them
    - Improve over time
