🌐 This GitHub project is (currently) a solo venture aimed at simulating and visualizing complex systems in order to make better decitions, 

<!-- 🌱 It starts simply with an agent moving randomly and eating randomly generated food, laying the foundation for emergent complexity. -->

👥 This repository serves as a starting point of my next bit project where the goal is to simulate mechanisms in society. 
🏙️ I.e. testing various economic/political models on simulated "agents" and comparing results etc.

🎨The simulation seeks to be both visually captivating and informative, 
with easily editable parameters to encourage user experimentation. 

🔥Targeting a wide audience, from friends to industry professionals, 
and aims to ignite a passion for complex adaptive systems.

🤝Feel free to reach out if you wish to collaborate, give feedback, or explore this project together with me!
